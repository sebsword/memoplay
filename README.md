A natively developed android application developed for dyslexic students to assist with memorising words and their definitions

Objectives
From the Interviews and the results collected from my survey as well as an extensive conversation with my end user, I have identified the following specific objectives:

1.	A platform with user submitted words and definitions that form a dictionary for the user to be tested on (this way definitions are tailored to the individual)
  a.	Interface must allow inputting of words through both physical and capacitive keyboards.
2.	A game that tests typing speed and accuracy.
  a.	Measure of typing speed must be calculated using acceptable methods.
3.	Mobile solution that can be used on the go, to cater to the busy life of a student.
  a.	Solution must be available on mobile devices
  b.	Main features must be available without an internet connection
    i.	New words should be stored locally on device
    ii.	Game should be playable with this local data
    iii.	Results may be stored remotely but should be accessible without an internet connection.
4.	Review of results that can be shared, supporting WhatsApp messaging.
5.	Ability to challenge friends on words and share definitions.
6.	A level up system based on typing speed, accuracy and definition length.
7.	Game difficulty must increase as the user progresses.

Measures
1)	The creation of a form for user to enter words between 3 and 50 characters in length, categories with length between 2 and 50 and defintions between 2 and 500 characters long. Succesful check on the database to verify that entries have been made.

2)	Return of a signalled response to the user indicating if a word has been typed correctly or not, successful calculation of a score from the number of words typed correctly (representing accuracy)

3)	The creation of an Android application that will download onto user’s devices supporting android 4.1 JellyBean to 7.0 Nougat (most recent version at time of writing)

4)	Succesful sharing of results with peers from a users whatsapp contact list

5)	The uploading of words to a remote database, automatic generation of links, allowing users to share definitions with whoever opens the link. All weblinks to the applications main domain, should open in the application rather than a browser. Data from these links should be downloaded to the recipient’s device and should be visible within the database.

6)	User’s level should be recorded from atleast levels 1-10, typing speeds should be measured in WPM using a recognised formula, longer character words should yield higher gains in experience and hence greater increases in level.

7)	Words should be omitted and redacted from the dispayed definition by a predefined amount calculated based on the players’ level, the words selected for omission should be selected randomly in order to add some level of variety to the gameplay.
